### Extreme mid-winter drought weakens tree hydraulic-carbohydrate systems and compromises tree growth

Rising temperatures and extended periods of drought compromise tree hydraulic and carbohydrate systems, threatening forest health globally. Despite winterâ€™s biological significance to many forests, the effects of warmer and dryer winters on tree hydraulic and carbohydrate status have largely been overlooked. This study built on California's extremely hot and dry winter in 2015 which can be seen in the figure below (vapor pressure deficit, or VPD, integrates temperature and relative humidity).

During this anomalous mid-winter drought, we measured that three tree species lost a large fraction of water in their trunks (measured as relative water content, or 'RWC') and significantly depleted their carbohydrate reserves (i.e. soluble carbohydrates, or 'SC' and starch, or 'St'). In the figure below, F14/F15 and M14/M15 indicate February 2014/2015 and May 2014/2015, respectively.

We developed a hierarchical, random effects model that used recent precipitation and seasonal vapor pressure deficit (VPD) anomaly to best predict the trends in tree relative water content observed. We tested ~1,000 potential models, selected the best model using AIC/BIC, and made the following predictions at the individual tree level.

Further examination of tree core records indicated a coordinated decline of tree growth with rising mid-winter, but not summer, VPD anomaly (VPD5d = 5 day VPD anomaly; P60d = cumulative 60 day precipitation).

Thus, our findings (suprisingly) suggested that tree hydraulic and non-structural carbohydrate vulnerability is seasonal and warm winters have major consequences for annual growth rates. These findings raised novel physiological and ecological questions about how rising winter temperatures will affect forest vitality as climate changes.
