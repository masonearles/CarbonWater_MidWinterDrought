# MidWinterDrought

Rising temperatures and extended periods of drought compromise tree hydraulic and carbohydrate systems, threatening forest health globally. Despite winterâ€™s biological significance to many forests, the effects of warmer and dryer winters on tree hydraulic and carbohydrate status have largely been overlooked. California had an extremely hot and dry winter in 2015 (vapor pressure deficit, or VPD, integrates temperature and relative humidity).

During this anomalous mid-winter drought, we measured that three tree species lost a large fraction of water in their trunks (measured as relative water content, or 'RWC') and depleted their carbohydrate reserves (i.e. soluble carbohydrates, or 'sc' and starch, or 'st').

We developed a model that used recent precipitation and seasonal vapor pressure deficit (VPD) anomaly to best predict the trends in tree relative water content observed.

Further examination of tree core records indicated a coordinated decline of tree growth with rising mid-winter, but not summer, VPD anomaly.

Thus, our findings suggest a seasonality to tree hydraulic and non-structural carbohydrate vulnerability with consequences for annual growth rates, raising novel physiological and ecological questions about how rising winter temperatures will affect forest vitality as climate changes.
